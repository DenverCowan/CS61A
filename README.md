# CS61A (https://cs61a.org)

I self-studied this material as a way to learn more about Python and Computer Science in general. I completed the first three projects but then moved on to study different material because I had a limited time frame and had no immediate reason to learn the Scheme programming language the latter phase of the course requires.

# Projects:

    1. Hog - Hog is a CLI based game which simulates dice rolls with different consequences depending on the results. You can learn more here: (https://cs61a.org/proj/hog/). Part of the game was to design strategies that your player would implement throughout the simulated dice rolls, some of theses strategies were defined by the teaching staff and you just had to implement them. But they left it as a challenge to design your own strategy that could outperform the pre-specified ones based on pre-written tests that measured your win percentage. I can proudly say that I was able to devise a multi-faceted strategt that outperformed all the pre-specified ones. :smile:

    2. Cats -  Cats is essentially a typeraced style game. I implemented backend only. There is a version which the course staff hosts on the web, which you can see in action here: (https://cats.cs61a.org)

    3. Ants vs Bees - A tower defense style game. This project focused on backend as well, specifically on object-oriented programming. This was a fun one and really made me start to appreciate the art in writing elegant object-oriented code. You can learn more about the project here: (https://cs61a.org/proj/ants/) or if you want to see it in action then just pull the code to your local machine, navigate to the directory containing **ants.py** and run `python3 gui.py` in your terminal.
